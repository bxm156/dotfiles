# Notes Directory

Personal notes organized by category and purpose.

## Directory Structure

- `inbox.md` - Quick capture for ideas, todos, and temporary notes
- `research/` - Research notes, learning materials, documentation
- `daily/` - Daily logs, journals, and meeting notes
- `projects/` - Project-specific notes and documentation

## Workflow

1. **Quick Capture**: Add items to `inbox.md` when you need to capture something quickly
2. **Process Inbox**: Regularly review inbox and move items to appropriate locations
3. **Organize**: Use subdirectories to keep related notes together
4. **Review**: Periodically review and archive or update notes

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `project-name.md`
- Include dates for daily notes: `2024-01-15.md`
- Use descriptive names for research: `topic-name.md`

## Tools

- Any text editor works - use what you prefer
- Markdown format for easy reading and version control
- Consider using `grep -r` to search across all notes
- Use `tree` to visualize directory structure

## Tips

- Keep notes in plain text/markdown for portability
- Use meaningful file names for easy searching
- Review and clean up old notes periodically
- Link between notes using relative paths when helpful
